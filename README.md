# Private Text Application

## Project Overview

The Private Text Application is a minimal server-side application designed to send private messages and manage file uploads with email notifications. It utilizes Express for routing, Socket.io for real-time communication, and Nodemailer for sending emails.

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/private-text-app.git

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will start and listen on port `8000` or the port specified in your environment variables.

### API Endpoints
